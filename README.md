# Discussions

  1. **Understand the Functional requirements** very well.. Even though you code great, you will still have issues, if some of the      requirements are NOT understood properly.
  2. Discuss and **finalize the Non-functional requirements** too. For example : concurrent uses , peak days of usage of application, performance related discussions etc.
  3. **Security of the application is very critical**. Review any Security based vulnerabilities that existed before and also in other apps and design/code to mitigate them.
  4. Make sure **Unit Testing** is accounted for and also good code coverage .
  5. Conduct any **security scans** and mitigate issues before going to production.
  6. Explain what was developed well to **QA team and review the QA TEST CASES by collaborating** so that any unknown scenarios or gaps are identified early.
  7. **User acceptance test** usually uncovers the functional issues mostly ,so understand the data of the application well and coordinate and make sure UAT covers all scenarios.
  8. **Work with Performance testing team** to conduct Load test etc and make sure that Non-functional requirements are taken care.
  9. **Watch how the application is being used by Users** and make sure they are trained well. If users are confused with the application, then they might give wrong requirements in the first place. So, this is a key function.

So, Code Quality consideration along with 9 above function verification will definitely make the application more stable.
